## Data Sources

    http://hotline.whalemuseum.org/api.json?limit=10000
    https://www.whaleresearch.com/







## Description

   Rationale: API data contains GeoJSON information to create maps, and the dataset is limited in scope but not too small. There is more data on marine mammal sightings beyond this API, but we didnâ€™t find other data that was easily accessible. Also orcas are endangered, so it is of interest to study their habits and habitats in order to help raise awareness for the orcas.  


            visualizations:
    1.	Use GeoJSON data to map sightings with markers for different species 
    2.	Use GeoJSON data to create a cluster and/or heatmap to visualize more active locations.
    3.	Look at seasonal sightings to map potential migratory patterns of orca pods.
    4.	Compare pod sightings to find where pods overlap and/or how frequently different pods interact together.
